Based on the official request from national authorities, the proposed project to strengthen the agricultural value chain and livelihoods in Zimbabwe (ZAVaCLEP) aims to improve agricultural production and resilience to climate change in order to improve the livelihoods of rural populations, as well as food and nutrition security.","The development objective of the project is to improve the sustainable production and productivity of crops and livestock, as well as to promote the integration of the agricultural MSME value chain, which should increase household incomes, create jobs, and strengthen food security in the targeted areas. The specific objectives of the project are (i) to improve the competitiveness of the beef and leather value chains by strengthening the production and processing capacities of stakeholders, (ii) improve the use of technologies to boost agricultural and livestock production, and (iii) reduce barriers to market access, which will contribute to improved incomes, food and nutrition security, and resilience to climate change.","The main beneficiaries of the project will be vulnerable rural livestock farmers, local entrepreneurs, and actors in the beef and leather value chain in the project districts. The project will directly benefit 7,000 livestock farmers and 42,000 smallholder farmers [50% women and 20% youth (ZIMSTAT: young people are aged between 15 and 35)]. In addition, 90,000 community members (50% women and 20% young people) will indirectly benefit from improved water supply, veterinary services, women's programs, and livelihoods. Most of the direct beneficiaries are already involved in livestock or crop farming, and the project will strengthen their technical skills, including processing, and their marketing capacity to increase their incomes. The participatory approach adopted in the project design involved direct beneficiaries, public sector institutions, and private sector actors who will actively participate in the commodity value chain.",ok,sections extracted successfully; working URL: https://mapafrica.afdb.org/en/projects/46002-P-ZW-AAG-008
P-EG-AAC-007,https://mapafrica.afdb.org/en/projects/46002-P-EG-AAC-007,"The feasibility study for rehabilitation/construction of zefta barrage was conceived in a context of competing needs for water and inadequate capacity to respond to the increasing demand for water resource. The Zefta Barrage is more than 100 years old and visible conditions of the barrage reveal cracks and scouring which adversely affect the stability of the structure and pose major risks of failure in the event of earthquakes. The present study is designed as a comprehensive detailed investigation to formulate a project for the rehabilitation of Zefta Barrage or reconstruction of a new barrage in replacement of the current structure as a solution for: (i) improved water management in 1 million feddans; (ii) increasing the availability of fresh water for irrigation of 3 million feddans additional agricultural land as well as domestic and industrial uses; (iii) navigation throughout the year; and (iv) miscellaneous uses by the beneficiaries. The execution of the study should be divided into four phases, including: 1) literature and presentation of study approach; 2) data collection and analysis of options; 3) preparation of viable projects; and 4) preparation of tender documents.","The sector goal is to develop and manage the very limited water resources in Egypt in the most efficient manner that satisfies all the needs whilst maintaining the sustainability of the resources through the application of the principles of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). The specific study objective is to determine the most technically viable, economically feasible, and environmental and socially acceptable option for the rehabilitation/reconstruction of Zefta Barrage, including the production of a comprehensive feasibility report and the associated engineering designs, bills of quantities and tender documents for the selected option.","The direct beneficiary of the study is the Egyptian State.

P-Z1-AA0-171,https://mapafrica.afdb.org/en/projects/46002-P-Z1-AA0-171,"In January 2023, the heads of state of 34 African countries gathered in Dakar for a summit jointly organized by the African Union (AU) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) on the theme “Feeding Africa: Food Sovereignty and Resilience.” The Dakar Declaration issued at the Summit was endorsed by a resolution of the 36th AU Summit held in February 2023, in which the Heads of State committed to (i) sustainably increase the production and productivity of agricultural value chains prioritized for achieving food sovereignty, as defined in the Food and Agriculture Compacts presented by the Heads of State, and (ii) strengthen access to public and private financing for food and agriculture. achieving food sovereignty as defined in the Food and Agriculture Compacts presented by the Heads of State, (ii) strengthening access to public and development partner financing, carrying out reforms conducive to private sector investment, and (iii) ensuring the implementation of the Compacts under the auspices of National Presidential Councils according to an established timetable. The review of the Compacts revealed that rice was unanimously recognized by Heads of State as a major strategic commodity for their food sovereignty. In this regard, REWARD is one of the Bank's flagship operational responses to financing the Compacts of West African countries. The Project will be financed by: (i) ADF resources (ADF loan and OR loan) in the amount of 14 million UC (86.74%), broken down as follows: ADF loan (7.000 million UC) and OR loan (7.000 million UC); and (ii) the Ivorian government, for 2.14 million UC (13.26%).","The main objective of the project is to strengthen food security and sovereignty in West Africa by promoting public and private investment in rice value chains (RVCs) to increase rice self-sufficiency and reduce the region's import bill by 2030. The choice of the project intervention area is justified by the country's desire to rehabilitate all rice production sites to ensure local rice self-sufficiency and reduce the production gap at the national level. In addition, the Yabra site has already been studied as part of the 2PAI-Bélier project, and the Sakassou site requires strong support in implementation to reach its maximum production potential.","The REWARD-CI covers two (02) regions of Côte d'Ivoire (Belier and Gbêkê) and concerns two (02) departments (Sakassou and Yamoussoukro). The sites covered by the project have a total area of 830 ha, including 450 ha for the Sakassou site and 380 ha for the Yabra site. The aim is to rehabilitate the irrigated area of Yabra and support farmers in the irrigated area of Sakassou. These are areas with high potential for rice production and development. A total of 1,660 producers (direct beneficiaries) will be reached, including 580 women (35%) and 415 young people (25%), and more than 30,000 indirect beneficiaries (users of improved seeds, mechanization, etc.). In addition to these actors, the project will impact economic operators, decentralized local authorities, decentralized structures of MEMINADERPV, etc.",ok,sections extracted successfully; working URL: https://mapafrica.afdb.org/en/projects/46002-P-Z1-AA0-171
