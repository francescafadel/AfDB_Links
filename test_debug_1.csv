P-ZW-AAG-008,https://mapafrica.afdb.org/en/projects/46002-P-ZW-AAG-008,"To boost production, the livestock sub-sector needs substantial investment to support smallholder farmers. Based on the official request from national authorities, the proposed project to strengthen the agricultural value chain and livelihoods in Zimbabwe (ZAVaCLEP) aims to improve agricultural production and resilience to climate change in order to improve the livelihoods of rural populations, as well as food and nutrition security.","The development objective of the project is to improve the sustainable production and productivity of crops and livestock, as well as to promote the integration of the agricultural MSME value chain, which should increase household incomes, create jobs, and strengthen food security in the targeted areas. The specific objectives of the project are (i) to improve the competitiveness of the beef and leather value chains by strengthening the production and processing capacities of stakeholders, (ii) improve the use of technologies to boost agricultural and livestock production, and (iii) reduce barriers to market access, which will contribute to improved incomes, food and nutrition security, and resilience to climate change.","The main beneficiaries of the project will be vulnerable rural livestock farmers, local entrepreneurs, and actors in the beef and leather value chain in the project districts. The project will directly benefit 7,000 livestock farmers and 42,000 smallholder farmers [50% women and 20% youth (ZIMSTAT: young people are aged between 15 and 35)]. In addition, 90,000 community members (50% women and 20% young people) will indirectly benefit from improved water supply, veterinary services, women's programs, and livelihoods. Most of the direct beneficiaries are already involved in livestock or crop farming, and the project will strengthen their technical skills, including processing, and their marketing capacity to increase their incomes. The participatory approach adopted in the project design involved direct beneficiaries, public sector institutions, and private sector actors who will actively participate in the commodity value chain.",ok,sections extracted successfully; working URL: https://mapafrica.afdb.org/en/projects/46002-P-ZW-AAG-008
