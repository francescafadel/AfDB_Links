Based on the official request from national authorities, the proposed project to strengthen the agricultural value chain and livelihoods in Zimbabwe (ZAVaCLEP) aims to improve agricultural production and resilience to climate change in order to improve the livelihoods of rural populations, as well as food and nutrition security.","The development objective of the project is to improve the sustainable production and productivity of crops and livestock, as well as to promote the integration of the agricultural MSME value chain, which should increase household incomes, create jobs, and strengthen food security in the targeted areas. The specific objectives of the project are (i) to improve the competitiveness of the beef and leather value chains by strengthening the production and processing capacities of stakeholders, (ii) improve the use of technologies to boost agricultural and livestock production, and (iii) reduce barriers to market access, which will contribute to improved incomes, food and nutrition security, and resilience to climate change.","The main beneficiaries of the project will be vulnerable rural livestock farmers, local entrepreneurs, and actors in the beef and leather value chain in the project districts. The project will directly benefit 7,000 livestock farmers and 42,000 smallholder farmers [50% women and 20% youth (ZIMSTAT: young people are aged between 15 and 35)]. In addition, 90,000 community members (50% women and 20% young people) will indirectly benefit from improved water supply, veterinary services, women's programs, and livelihoods. Most of the direct beneficiaries are already involved in livestock or crop farming, and the project will strengthen their technical skills, including processing, and their marketing capacity to increase their incomes. The participatory approach adopted in the project design involved direct beneficiaries, public sector institutions, and private sector actors who will actively participate in the commodity value chain.",ok,sections extracted successfully; working URL: https://mapafrica.afdb.org/en/projects/46002-P-ZW-AAG-008

During its implementation, this project was evaluated in March 2009 following an emergency following the collapse of the Massingir Dam's bottom drain, which resulted in uncontrollable discharge of water. The Mozambican government then sought the support of the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) to remedy this situation. To this end, the AfDB reacted promptly by approving in July 2009 an emergency loan of UA 13.30 million (considered as an additional loan) for the repair of the bottom drain at the total estimated cost of UA 21.4 million, the balance to be borne by the Government of Mozambique. Initially, the project consisted of two main components: (i) component A: Rehabilitation of the Massingir Dam sump; ii) Component B: Project Management.

COCOBOD is a fully state-owned company solely responsible for Ghana’s cocoa industry, controlling the purchase, marketing and export of all cocoa beans produced in the country. The objective of the PEPs is to roll out a set of measures that will improve productivity per hectare and increase cocoa production levels well above 1 million tonnes per year (versus an average of 800,000 tonnes per year over the last ten years). The PEPs will mainly entail measures to sustainably increase plant fertility; develop irrigation systems;  rehabilitate  aged  and  disease-infected  farms;  increase  warehouse  capacity;  and  create  an integrated farmer database. The programmes will also provide short-term working capital support to local cocoa-processing companies, thus facilitating domestic value addition and consumption of cocoa products in Ghana. This long-term investment would help to boost cocoa production through the rehabilitation of ageing plantations, finance new warehouses to store cocoa beans longer and boost the processing of cocoa beans. The Bank is expected to play two roles in this transaction; namely (i) acting as initial Mandated Lead Arranger (MLA) ; and (ii) providing up to a maximum amount of USD 150 million secured senior loan to catalyze the participation of commercial lenders, given their customary limited risk appetite for tenures longer than the one-and three-year facilities that they have been accustomed to providing to COCOBOD.","COCOBOD will use the facility to raise cocoa yields per hectare and increase Ghana’s overall production. These include financial interventions to sustainably increase cocoa plant fertility, improving irrigation systems, rehabilitating aged and disease-infected farms. The funds will also help increase warehouse capacity and provide support to local cocoa-processing companies. Key development outcomes also include increase in sustainable farm productivity; effective disease control and management; agricultural transformation with domestic value-addition.","The operation is a mechanism for scaling up the cocoa value chain and will help to ensure higher incomes for Ghana’s cocoa farmers. It portends very strong gender and youth employment impacts as the cocoa sector employs mostly youth and women. The sector represents 8.2% of Ghana’s GDP, employs over 800,000 farmers, and supports the livelihood of around 4 million people and accounts for over 67% of household income.

It is one of AfDB’s ENABLE Youth Initiatives under the Bank’s Feed Africa Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa. The Bank’s ENABLE Youth initiative is a comprehensive program that builds entrepreneurship in agribusiness via skill acquisition and creates an enabling environment in which young men and women become owners of profitable agribusinesses. The program seeks to encourage the creation and growth of growth of sustainable commercially viable youth agribusinesses by supporting the development of wellstructured agribusiness projects, and providing commercial loans and other financial products/services available for investment in a range of agribusiness ventures, market access, capacity development, risk management, and networking. Eritrea was among the countries in the continent that expressed keen interest in participating in the Bank’s ENABLE Youth Program and requested the Bank’s support for financing. The project will contribute to the objectives of the country’s Integrated Five-year Agricultural Strategic Plan (2019-2023) by identifying innovative and enterprising youth agripreneurs who are willing to pursue business opportunities in agribusiness along key agricultural value chains in the country. It will engage all stakeholders along the agricultural value chain, thus strengthening the entrepreneurship ecosystem and growth of agribusiness ventures. Moreover, the project promotes Public-Private Partnership (PPP) through active collaboration with private enterprises including their participation in the training and apprenticeship of beneficiary students. The total cost is estimated at UA 14.38 million, of which AfDB is financing UA 13.12 million (91.2 %). The project implementation is expected to start in 2020 with a duration of five years.","The overall goal of the Bank’s ENABLE Youth Program is to contribute to job creation, food and nutrition security, income generation and improved low carbon climate resilient livelihoods for youths in both urban and rural areas. The specific objective of the ENABLE Youth Eritrea project is to create business opportunities and decent employment for young women and men along priority agricultural value chains through the provision of entrepreneurship skills, funding and business linkages.","The targeted beneficiaries are youth between the ages of 18 to 35 years with at least a secondary school graduates/certificate in any field of study with 50% participation of each gender.

The project is structured around six (06) components, namely: (A) support for agricultural production; (B) support for livestock production; (C) development of lowlands; (D) rehabilitation of rural roads; (E) agricultural and rural credit; and (F) project management and monitoring and evaluation.","The sectoral objective of PRODABEK is to strengthen food security and improve the income and living conditions of the population in the project area (prefectures of Beyla and Kérouané). Specifically, the project aims to increase agro-pastoral production while safeguarding the agro-ecological balance of the terroirs, with the active participation of the beneficiary population.","The main direct beneficiaries of PRODABEK are the agro-pastoralists who own the agricultural holdings managed by the project in its intervention area. The other direct beneficiaries of the project are: (i) beekeeping groups, village blacksmiths and agro-pastoralists, (ii) rice producer groups in the lowlands, (iii) beneficiaries of credit actions, the majority of whom are women, (iv) beneficiaries of actions with a social component of the project, including women and young people, and (v) structured farmer organizations.",ok,sections extracted successfully; working URL: https://mapafrica.afdb.org/en/projects/46002-P-GN-AA0-007

La lagune communique avec l'océan par une série de chenaux se réunissant en une passe unique au niveau du village d'Assinie-Mafia. La population autour de la lagune est de 46.000 personnes (40 villages). L'activité de base est la pêche même si chaque famille pratique des cultures vivrières de subsistance. Les femmes s'occupent du fumage du poisson (1.580 fumeuses). La pêche comprend deux secteurs bien distincts selon les engins utilisés: la pêche collective (1.200 pêcheurs) utilisant des sennes Aly et des sennes tournantes, la pêche individuelle (800 pêcheurs) avec des filets maillant à une nappe, des guideaux à crevettes, des éperviers et des nappes en fibres végétales. Les ressources halieutiques comprennent 3 groupes de poissons (Ethlamose, Cichlidae, Chrysichthys) et 3 crustacés exploitables. La surexploitation des ressources provoque une baisse des prises et une baisse concomitante du revenu des pêcheurs.","La population cible du projet est composée des 46.000 habitants de l'ensemble des villages existants autour de la lagune dont 2.000 pêcheurs et 1.580 fumeuses.

Objectifs et composantes du projet

Les objectifs principaux du projet sont l'amélioration des conditions de vie et des revenus des pêcheurs et des fumeuses par le biais d'une exploitation rationnelle des ressources de la lagune Aby et de l'utilisation d'un matériel de pêche approprié.

Les composantes du projet sont les suivantes:

Vulgarisation, encadrement et gestion: encadrement des pêcheurs et encouragement du recours à des techniques adéquates de pêche, expérimentations et démonstrations d'aquaculture et de fumage, formation, soutien des groupements de pêcheurs et aide pour leurs demandes de crédit.
Assistance directe à la pêche et au fumage: un volet investissements directs comprenait l'installation d'une chambre froide, un four amélioré, des enclos d'aquaculture et des acadjas. Un système de crédit réalisé en étroite collaboration avec la BNDA devait financer la pêche, le fumage, la commercialisation de poisson frais et l'aquaculture.
Infrastructures socio-économiques: construction de 11 débarcadères, de 40 puits (20 nouveaux, 20 à réhabiliter), de 3 marchés ruraux et d'un centre de services pour la réparation, l'entretien et la maintenance des moteurs d'embarcations.
Formation, suivi et évaluation: le suivi devait être assuré par la Direction des Pêches et 3 évaluations de 2 mois devaient être effectuées. Deux expertises devaient être réalisées: étude des disponibilités en bois, une expertise en comptabilité.","Composante infrastructures socio-économiques: 29 débarquadères, au lieu des 11 prévus, ont été construits à cause de la pression exercée par les populations riveraines et les responsables politiques locaux (moyen de désenclaver les villages situés autour de la lagune). 28 puits ont été réalisés. Au lieu d'un centre de services, le projet a ouvert un magasin de vente de pièces détachées qui n'a fonctionné qu'en 1987, les pêcheurs préférant s'approvisionner directement sur les marchés ghanéens ou sur le marché de Dabou à des prix nettement moins élevés. 3 marchés couverts ont été réalisés mais ne sont pas utilisés par les commerçants (prix d'acquisition des stands trop élevés). Un local administratif et 2 logements ont aussi été construits.

Composante encadrement administratif: l'encadrement des pêcheurs a consisté en la mise en place de 4 conseillers de pêche (au lieu de 6 prévus), l'organisation de réunions d'information, la visite systématique des pêcheurs dans leur village, des déplacements ponctuels en cas de conflits particuliers. Le projet a aidé à la constitution de 8 GVC et de plusieurs groupes informels devant constituer à terme de nouveaux GVC. La vulgarisation de nouvelles techniques de fumage s'est effectuée sous forme de démonstrations (24 séances). Des comités d'hygiène villageois ont été constitués et ont permis une diminution notable des maladies diarrhéiques au sein de la population cible.

Assistance directe à la pêche et au fumage: 8 crédits pêche ont été octroyés à des GVC pour un montant total de 19.231.930 FCFA (financement des armements de pêche artisanale lagunaire), 1 prêt à un GVC de fumeuses qui n'a pas été remboursé, aucun prêt pour la mise en place de chaines de froid ou pour l'aquaculture. Au total, le montant déboursé par la BNDA s'élève en juillet 1988 à 17,43 millions de FCFA soit 3,9% du montant prévu. Comme investissements directs, ont été construits, 4 fours de démonstration (type ""Adiaké"" et ""Chorkor""), une fabrique de glace. Deux types d'expérimentation d'acadjas ont été menés (acadja traditionnel et acadja en bambou non enclos). Le projet a construit un catamaran et 6 pirogues (non prévus) qui se sont révélés inadaptés par absence de flottabilité et n'ont pu être exploités.

Formation: ce volet n'a pas eu l'ampleur prévue (203 jours de formation sur 604 prévus).

Le suivi et l'évaluation: aucune unité n'a été mise en place.

En 1987, un certain nombre de mesures ayant pour but de rationnaliser l'effort de pêche et de préserver la resource renouvelables ont été prises: interdiction des sennes tournantes, mise en place d'un système de licences de pêche, fermeture de la pêche pendant 6 mois de l'année.

Appréciation des effets du projet et de leur perennité

Effets sur les revenus des bénéficiaires: les pêcheurs individuels utilisant les filets maillants parviennent actuellement à améliorer les niveaux de revenus observés en 1982 (290.000 FCFA de revenu annuel actuellement et 188.000 en 1982). La rentabilité des sennes de plage est insuffisante. Les revenus des fumeuses marquent une croissance de 107% par rapport à 1982.

Impact sur les conditions de vie: les débarcadères ont permis de désenclaver certains villages; les puits ont réduit fortement le nombre de maladies diarrhéiques.

Effets sur les revenus et les conditions de vie des femmes:la présence des puits permet d'alléger la pénibilité de l'approvisionnement en eau qui pèse essentiellement sur les femmes et les enfants. Les revenus des fumeuses ont augmentés (voir para 15).

Impact sur l'emploi: l'adoption de mesures destinées à supprimer l'usage des sennes tournantes et à enrayer la chute du niveau de production a eu un impact défavorable sur l'emploi (beaucoup de pêcheurs étrangers sont retournés dans leur pays). En revanche, les actions d'assistance aux GVC ont permis à 107 menbres de GVC de développer leur activité dans la zone du projet et de s'y stabiliser.

Effets sur l'environnement et sur la base de ressource:depuis 1985, on observe une diminution de la production et des rendements ce qui confirme la tendance antérieure de baisse des stocks que le projet n'a pas réussi à renverser. Chaque amélioration des rendements observés après chaque période de fermeture reste fragile et de moins en moins importante d'une période de fermeture à l'autre.

L'existence du projet a permis de renforcer les capacités techniques et humaines de la direction des pêches, d'intaurer une étroite collaboration entre les differents acteurs concernés par les problèmes de pêche sur la lagune Aby, de renforcer les institutions traditionnelles (chefs de village et administratives (chefs de canton) dans leur role d'arbitre des conflits et de participants aux prises de décision (fermeture de la pêche, instauration d'un système de licences.

Principaux problèmes rencontrés

L'incapacité du projet à enrayer la baisse des stocks

La baisse des stocks concerne l'ensemble des espèces (pas seulement l'Ethlamose). On peut distinguer deux facteurs:

des conditions défavorables: des facteurs hydrologiques négatifs (faibles apports) et un ensablement des chenaux de la passe d'Assinie.
une surexploitation liée à une augmentation de la puissance de pêche. La quasi totalité des sennes de plage de grande longueur et de chute importante sont encore en activité et le nombre de filets syndicats a tendance à augmenter ainsi que le nombre d'engins individuels (filets maillants grande maille et éperviers).
Les efforts entrepris par le projet pour limiter la pression sur les stocks disponibles (interdiction des sennes tournantes, licences, fermeture saisonnière de la pêche) vont dans le bon sens mais ne sont pas suffisants. Quelques erreurs ont cependant été commises: 73% des crédits accordés l'ont été pour l'achat de 4 grands filets dont l'effet destructeur sur les stocks d'Ethlamose et de Machoirons n'est plus à démontrer.

Des insuffisances dans l'administration du projet

Exception faite des procès verbaux des réunions du conseil d'organisation et de suivi,aucun rapport d'activité n'est publié. La mission n'a pu disposer d'aucun document décrivant les activités du projet ou établissant un bilan des réalisations physiques et financières. La gestion comptable laisse également à désirer puisqu'un seul journal comptable est tenu et qu'aucun autre état financier n'est élaboré. Enfin, les coûts de fonctionnement notamment au niveau du poste carburant du parc de véhicules se sont révélés parfois excessifs.

Recommandations et leçons à tirer

Les propositions en matière d'aménagement de la pêche visent à maitriser l'effort de pêche, en veillant à privilégier les mesures dont la mise en oeuvre s'avère la plus aisée. La fermeture annuelle de la saison de pêche constitue une mesure indispensable à la reconstitution des stocks. Sa durée doit être fonction de l'effort de pêche entrepris et surtout de l'évolution de la situation de la lagune. Le suivi des captures et de la biologie des espèces sera déterminant. Le système des licences doit être maintenu et leur nombre limité. Il doit être accompagné de l'enregistrement de tous les engins de pêche et de la création d'une brigade de surveillance. L'expérimentation d'une senne de plage rénovée et de taille limitée est opportune en raison de l'absence de sélectivité des sennes utilisées actuellement. Les efforts de pêche devraient porter sur les stocks actuellement sous-exploités; une action de développement de la pêche au crabe pourrait bénéficier à une centaine de pêcheurs.

Le projet devrait intensifier ses efforts pour le développement des acadjas (3 ha en 1989 et 5 ha l'année suivante si les résultats sont positifs).

Les démonstrations des nouveaux fours se tiendront dans 20 villages. Une campagne de promotion de l'utilisation de la glace devrait être lancée.

En ce qui concerne la chambre froide que le GVC d'Assinie se propose de construire, une étude préalable sur la pêche et la commercialisation de la crevette doit être entreprise.

Une cellule de suivi et une cellule d'évaluation doivent être créées et coordonnées.

Afin de mettre en place des procédures comptables et une structure organisationnelle plus efficiente, la mission recommande de recourir à des missions d'expertise comptable et administrative. Un état comptable du projet doit être établi et soumis à un audit.

L'équipe des conseillers de pêche doit être renforcée et dotée d'outils de travail plus fonctionnels. Un accord avec le Centre de Recherche Océanographique permettra de rassembler les données nécessaires au suivi biologique et socio-économique des actions du projet.

Pour que les mesures préconisées s'avèrent efficaces, elles doivent s'inscrire dans un care institutionnel qui rallie le consensus des populations attenantes à la lagune et les impliquent dans la mise en oeuvre mais aussi dans la définition globale d'un plan d'aménagement de l'environnement lagunaire.",ok,sections extracted successfully; working URL: https://mapafrica.afdb.org/en/projects/46002-P-CI-AAF-001

The contract was eventually terminated. The project remains nearly 60% completed with UA 13.44 million disbursed. There have not been any disbursements since 9th March 1989. The Government has confirmed that the dispute between the Government and Messrs. ABU and Partners has been resolved with no legal or financial obligations to the Bank. On 18th December 1997, the Government requested Bank's approval to revise the list of works and services with a view to completing the project by utilizing the remaining UA 10.23 million. The Bank approved the Government's request on 19th April 1999, with the revised deadline for final disbursement being 31st December 2002. Since the approval of the revised list of works and services, the Government has entered into contract with a consulting firm for the design review, pre-tender activities and supervision of works. The draft tender documents are currently being reviewed by the Bank. However, the pre-qualifying contractors is completed. However, the Government has been very slow in implementing the project.

Le climat est aride avec de violentes précipitations qui ravinent les sols et inondent les fonds de vallées.

Avant la mise en oeuvre du projet, la zone comprenait 2.600 ha de cultures sèches (association mais-haricot sur des pentes souvent fortes et très érodées) et 50 ha de cultures partiellement irrguées (canne à sucre principalement). Les rendements variaient selon les pluies de 0 à 1.200 kg/ha pour le mais et de 0 à 300kg/ha pour le haricot. La plupart des paysans exploitent les terres en régime indirect. Les exploitations sont de taille modeste, 1,5 ha en moyenne, dont plus de 90% en sec. La production agricole est limitée par la faible disponibilité en eau et la détérioration du patrimoine foncier par l'érosion. Le chomage et le sous-emploi sont très importants.","Le projet de développement agricole intégré d'Assomada vise à augmenter la production agricole, à réduire la dépendance à l'aide alimentaire extérieure et à augmenter l'emploi et les revenus ruraux.

Ses objectifs spécifiques sont d'améliorer les cultures sèches par des mesures de conservation et d'aménagement des sols et d'utiliser la mobilisation et la distribution d'eau afin d'irriguer 150 ha dans la zone du projet.

Les composantes du projet étaient les suivantes:

- Travaux de lutte contre l'érosion et aménagement des terres: les terres destinées aux cultures pluviales doivent être aménagées et les superficies cultivées en mais et en haricots sur les terres en pentes doivent être réduites et remplacées par du cajanus cajan. Il était prévu d'effectuer des travaux de DRS sur les pentes inférieures à 40% sur 830 ha et sur les pentes supérieures à 40% sur 1.300 ha; la construction de 61 ha de terrasses pouvant être irriguées; la construction de 1.911 seuils de retenue et de 86 barrage de retenue pour irriguer 89 ha.
- Fourniture et distribution d'eau d'irrigation: mise en place d'infrastructures de mobilisation et de distribution d'eau pour irriguer 150 ha. Il était prévu de creuser 3.000m de galeries captantes horizontales, 18 puits dans les fonds de vallées, d'aménager ou de remettre en état le réseau des 150 ha à irriguer.
- Autres infrastructures: amélioration de 17 km de routes d'accès, captage de 40 sources pour l'alimentation en eau des villages, rénovation et construction de batiments devant servir de bureaux et de logements pour le personnel de projet.
La section agronomie du projet devait mettre en place un système de vulgarisation; une section de génie civil devait préparer les plans d'exécution des infrastructures, la construction, l'entretien et le fonctionnement des ouvrages du projet. Le Bureau des Statistiques était chargé du suivi et de l'évaluation du projet.","Le groupe cible n'est pas spécifiquement identifié. La population rurale de la zone est de 9.500 personnes soit 1.600 familles.

Dans le domaine de la lutte contre l'érosion, l'aménagement de 830 ha de terrasses en sec a du être abandonné principalement en raison de son coût. 375 ha de semis de pois d'Angol formant des haies vives suivant les courbes de niveau et alternant avec la culture de mais-haricot ont pu être réalisés. Les 1.300 ha de semis de pois d'Angol en banquettes individuelles ont été remplacés (raisons de coût) par 1.130 ha de semis continu en pois d'Angol mais sans aménagement de banquettes.

Le surcoût de l'aménagement de terrasses à irriguer et la faible disponibilité en eau ont limité les réalisations à 4 ha au lieu des 61 ha prévus. Certaines infrastructures non prévues ont été réalisées: construction de 3,2 km de murs longitudinaux pour protéger les exploitations des vallées contre les crues des rivières. D'autre part, le projet a exécuté un programme FAO/Belgique de reboisement et a procédé à la plantation de 815 ha qui concourent grandement au contrôle de l'érosion dans la zone de projet.

La composante mobilisation et distribution d'eau d'irrigation a été fortement réduite en raison de la faiblesse des disponibilités en eau souterraine. Ont été réalisés: 360m de galerie filtrante, 6 puits, 1,7 km de canaux primaires, 1,9 km de canaux secondaires. Aussi n'ont pu être irrigués correctement que 32 ha et partiellement 22 ha sur les 150 ha irrigués prévus.

Comme autres infrastructures, le projet a réalisé 20 fontaines publiques (50 prévues), deux centres de collecte destinés à la commercialisation des produits agricoles, 20 km de routes de desserte (17 prévus), la construction de batiments devant accueillir l'administration du projet, la construction d'une porcherie et de ses dépendances (non prévu).",ok,sections extracted successfully; working URL: https://mapafrica.afdb.org/en/projects/46002-P-CV-AB0-001
